# integers include all whole numbers, both positive and negative, as well as zero   
# Examples of integers
# 5
# -3
# 0
# 12
# -45
# 98
# -100
# 22
# -7
# 42


# A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within quotes 
# Strings include letters, numbers, symbols and even spaces
# Examples of strings
# "Hello"
# "12345"
# "Python is awesome"
# "Amateur"
# "True"
# "apple"
# "Welcome to the world"
# "abc123"
# "12.34"
# "  "


# Floats are numbers that contain a decimal point or are expressed in scientific notation.
# Examples of floats
# 3.14
# -2.5
# 0.0
# 7.89
# -10.25
# 1.5
# 99.99
# -4.56
# 2.718
# 100.0


# Tuples are ordered collection of elements, and they can contain different types of data e.g integers, strings e.t.c
# Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created
# Examples of tuples
# (1,2,3)
# ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
# (5, 'hello', True)
# (100, 200, 300, 400)
# ('cat', 7, 'dog')
# (3.14, 2.71, 1.61)
# ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
# (True, False)
# ('red', 42, 'blue')
# (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 )


# Lists can contain different types of elements, such as integers, stings, booleans, floating-point numbers, even other lists as well
# Lists are ordered and mutable, meaning you can change their elements after creation
# Examples of lists
# [1,2,3,4,5]
# ['apple', 'banana']
# [True, False]
# [1.5, 2.3, 3.7]
# ['a', 1, True, 3.5]
# [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# [None, 'hello', 42]
# ['dog', 'cat', 'rabbit']
# [3,5,7,9]
# [['apple', 'orange'], [1, 2, 3]]


# A set is an unordered collection of unique elements
# It does'nt allow duplicates, and the order of elements is not preserved
# Sets can obtain different types of elements (integers, strings, booleans e.t.c)
# Union symbol [|] and intersection symbol [&]
# When calling out a set one uses curly braces {} or set constructor ([])
# Examples of sets
# {1,2,3,4,5}
# {10,20,30,40}
# {'apple', 'banana', 'avocado'}
# {3.14, 2.71, 1.61}
# {True, False}
# {1,2,2,3,3,3,3}
# {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
# {0, 5, -1, 2, -3}
# {1, 'hello', 3.14}
# {} #an empty set creates an empty dictionary


# A boolean can only have one of two possible values. True or False
# They are often used in conditional statements and logical operators
# Examples of boolean values
# True
# False
# True and False
# 5 > 3
# 2 == 2
# 3 != 3
# not True
# False or True
# 10 <= 5
# True and True


# A dictionary in python is a collection of key value pairs.
# Each key is unique, and it maps to a value. The keys can be strings, numbers, or other immutable types, while values are str, numbers, lists
# Examples of dictionaries
# person = {"name":"John", "age":20, "city":"harare"}
# student = {"name":"alice", "grade":"a"}
# car = {"brand":"toyota", "model":"corolla"}
# book = {"title":"the genesis of zimbabwe", "author":"dennis richards"}
# fruit_prices = {"apple":2.5, "banana":3.0}
# coordinates = {"x":10, "y":20}
# employee = {"name":"Mike", "position":"manager"}
# organization = {"name":"uncommon", "location":"harare"}
# animal = {"species":"cat", "color":"black"}


# None is a special null like value used to indicate the absence of a value or a null object
# It is often used to represent missing values, default function arguments, or a placeholder
# Examples of the none data type
# None
# x = None
# def my_function(): return None
# y = None
# result = None
# my_list = [1,2,None,4]
# my_dict = {"key_1":None}
# class MyClass: def_init__(self):self.value = None
# print(None)
